TrackStar
=========
Welcome to the **TrackStar 0.0.0.dev0** documentation!
This software is in early development and does not yet have an official name.

TrackStar, at its core, is a tool for esimating best-fit parameters for
models whose chief prediction is a **track** in some observed space.
Such models arise, e.g., within astrophysics, in the context of stellar
isochrones, one-zone galactic chemical evolution models, and stellar
streams.
A **track** is any infinitely thin trajectory through some N-dimensional
space of observed quantities.
In this context, a model can be said to predict a track if in the absence of
measurement uncertainties, every datum would fall perfectly along this
trajectory with some arbitrary distribution.
