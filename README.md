# Track-Fitting

This software is in early development and does not yet have an official name.
The goals and features of this code are:

<ol>
	<li>
		Compute the likelihood of observing a datum in some observed space
		given an infinitely thin, model-predicted track in the observed space.
	</li>
	<li>
		Implement item (1) in a manner that is computationally fast and
		efficient.
	</li>
	<li>
		Extend item (2) across a whole data set in which each respective datum
		may or may not contain measurements of the same quantities as the
		others.
	</li>
</ol>
